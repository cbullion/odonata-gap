TTILE: Data Gap

ABSTRACT: 
Observations of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) across five focal counties for the summer months of 2019. Each observation possesses taxonomic information (genus, scientific name, suborder), spatial information (county and site), and date of the observation. The dataset consists of two files, representing their respective sampling source.
